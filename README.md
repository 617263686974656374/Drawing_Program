# Drawing Program

## Description
The Drawing Program is an educational application written in Python using the `tkinter` library. Its purpose is to help students learn how to work with coordinates and visualize objects. The program allows drawing lines and rectangles, providing an interactive way to understand geometric concepts and spatial thinking.

## Features

1. **Drawing objects**:
   - Lines
   - Rectangles

2. **Interactive elements**:
   - Real-time display of mouse coordinates
   - Manual input of coordinates

3. **Control tools**:
   - Clear the entire canvas
   - Toggle grid visibility on the canvas

4. **Color-coded markers**:
   - Start points (green)
   - End points (red)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (part of Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Download the source code of the program.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launching the program**:
   - Upon launching, the main application window will open.

2. **Drawing on the canvas**:
   - Select the drawing mode (line or rectangle).
   - Click and drag on the canvas to create an object.

3. **Manual coordinate input**:
   - Click the “Enter coordinates” button.
   - Enter the start and end coordinates and confirm.

4. **Clearing the canvas**:
   - Click the “Clear All” button to remove all objects from the canvas.

5. **Toggling the grid**:
   - Click the “Show/Hide Grid” button to toggle grid visibility on the canvas.

## Files

- `main.py`: Main application script

## Customization

You can modify the program code to fit your needs. For example, you can adjust:

- Canvas dimensions (`width`, `height`)
- Object styles and colors (e.g., `fill`, `outline`)
